# StartUpApp
A java program to create and edit profiles with files paths to be executed.
 This project is simple but it was to challenge me to deal with a problem with what i knew and could research with java to resolve it.
  The root of this problem was a friend, thats was cofiguring a .bat file to open all the apps he need for his work, so that gave me the ideia for a more casual approach for non-tech users, i tried so simplify this automation with java and JavaSwing for the GUI.
  So you can create, delete and edit profiles, those are saved into a profile folder winto the program folder that is a txt, you can input a direct path into a text field on the edit tab or use file explorer to find an .exe or .lnk, and selecting the profile then start open every app on the profile.txt.
